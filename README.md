# KinectMouse
The project that went along with my high school graduation work. This repo explores one way to control a computer hands-free, using the Kinect V2 camera.
Consists of a basic config file and the main program, written in Processing because of it's graphic nature, and implements the KinectPV2 library.
Currently supports all basic mouse functions and and can call the Windows On-Screen Keyboard for keyboard use.
